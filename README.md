# games-together
Simple site that can be embedded to make it easier to create and play online games together. Goal to make generalizable game object in https://gather.town/, but probably can be embedded and used elsewhere!

Mostly just modeled after their Skribb.io page (lets you both create game and enter a URL).

How to use with Gather Town:
1. In Build mode or Mapmaker, add an object
2. Select any item (e.g. Game Box (Generic)), and make it an **Embeddable Website**
3. Enter "https://rhaor.github.io/" into **Website (URL)**
4. Choose an appropriate activation distance
5. You're ready to go! :)

If there are any games you'd like added or you have feedback on the site, service, or code, would love to hear it! Start a conversation on this repo or reach out directly to _rhaowork at gmail.com_. Happy gaming!
